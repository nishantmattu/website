    <p>I am currently a Software Engineer Associate at Lockheed Martin. Previously, I have interned as a Software/Hardware Engineer Intern at Altera (now Intel-PSG) and a Software Engineer Intern at Samsung. I graduated from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo in June 2016 with a BS in Electrical Engineering.</p>

    <p>Although my main focus in college was hardware engineering, I developed a curiosity for software through my internships, elective classes, and personal experience. With a "learn by doing" mentality, I am continuing to follow this interest by exploring the many fields and flavors of software in my job and spare time.</p>

    <p>I learned the process of building websites as well as the intricacies of the frontend and backend. Moreover, I built some pretty cool applications that gave me an opportunity to apply what I learned and helped strengthen my fundamentals. I enjoyed working with JavaScript and its frameworks (NodeJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS) as well as Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. Check out my projects tab and CodeSandbox link at the bottom!</p> 

    <p>I finished Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. I learned theory behind various machine learning topics and algorithms. I also applied my knowledge on a handful of homework assignments. I familiarized myself with various python libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib) by playing around with datasets that I found on Kaggle.</p>

    <p>In addition to all that technical stuff, I enjoy a variety of other activities. For instance, I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by exploring the outdoors and going to the gym. I occasionally go to volunteering events and help out in my community. Before my current job, I started a tech blog that I hope to continue adding content to soon. I also like to keep up with the latest movies and television shows. Most importantly, I am always looking for opportunities to try new things and step out of my comfort zone. Some recent activities that I attempted for the first time were driving around San Francisco in a GoCar (three wheel motorcycle), solving an Escape Room, and riding an ATV.</p>
