    <p>I am currently a Software Engineer Associate at Lockheed Martin. Previously, I have interned as a Software/Hardware Engineer Intern at Altera (now Intel-PSG) and a Software Engineer Intern at Samsung. I graduated from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo in June 2016 with a BS in Electrical Engineering.</p>

    <p>Although my main focus in college was hardware engineering, I developed a curiosity for software through my internships, elective classes, and personal experience. With a "learn by doing" mentality, I am continuing to follow this interest by exploring the many fields and flavors of software in my job and spare time. </p>

    <p>I started off by jumping into the realm of Web Development. I learned the process of building websites as well as the intricacies of the frontend and backend. Moreover, I built some pretty cool applications that gave me an opportunity to apply what I learned and helped strengthen my fundamentals. I enjoyed working with JavaScript and its frameworks (NodeJS, ExpressJS, AngularJS) as well as Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.</p> 

    <p>More recently, I discovered the world of Data Science. The idea of playing around with data and trying to create a story drew me to this field. I immediately started reading documentation on Python's libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib). I created an account on Kaggle and started messing around with the available datasets. Additionally, I began Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera to learn how the algorithms worked and how to apply them in a practical setting. I am also reading about statistical learning and reviewing important mathematics to help me understand what is going on under the hood. I definitely believe I found my passion and cannot wait to see what's in store as I continue my journey in Data Science. After building a solid foundation, I hope to start applying my knowledge and building on what I have learned by competing in Kaggle competitions.</p>

    <p>In addition to all that technical stuff, I enjoy a variety of other activities. For instance, I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by exploring the outdoors and going to the gym. I occasionally go to volunteering events and help out in my community. Before my current job, I started a tech blog that I hope to continue adding content to soon. I also like to keep up with the latest movies and television shows. Most importantly, I am always looking for opportunities to try new things and step out of my comfort zone. Some recent activities that I attempted for the first time were driving around San Francisco in a GoCar (three wheel motorcycle), solving an Escape Room, and riding an ATV.</p>
