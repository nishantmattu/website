			<h1>Academic Experience</h1>	

			<img id="gtechImg" src="./img/gtech.jpg">
			<p>During my BSEE, I completed technical electives that covered foundational CS concepts, including object-oriented programming with Java, data structures, and design and analysis of algorithms. Through various EE classes, I also worked with low-level languages, such as C and VHDL, and embedded technologies.</p>

			

				<p>Through my MSCS, I plan to take a wide array of courses that span across multiple facets of software engineering. Some of the courses I am interested in taking are machine learning, artificial intelligence, and operating systems. I have covered many of these topics on my own through online research, work experience, and personal projects but wanted to understand them from a more theoretical perspective as well.</p>

			<h1>Current Interests</h1>	

			<img id="webDevImg" src="./img/webdev.jpg">
			<p>Additionally, I have an avid interest in web-development and am using what I have learned to create exciting applications. I am utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to design and develop interactive and responsive UIs. Moreover, I have worked with different JavaScript frameworks and libraries, including React.js, Redux, Node.js, and Express.js, to make these applications more functional and dynamic. I have also explored various APIs from Twitter, Flickr, Google, and YouTube. Through this experience, I have learned about a lot of different web concepts and technologies, covering REST, AJAX, headers, and CORS, just to name a few. </p>
